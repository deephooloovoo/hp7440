notes: 
    The cypress RAM part should be a drop-in replacement. 
    I couldn't find exactly the right size of prom, but you can just tile the
higher address lines low to limit it to the first 16k. Other chips are usable
here too - I have a stash of eproms that I rescued from the garbage, so I'll
probably use those
    It might be useful to have sockets. I'm not sure if that fits mechanically.
    I don't know how long the pins should be. I'll need to add those
    I don't know what the diodes or capacitors are. but they're labeled on the 
document, and I'm not worrying about it.
